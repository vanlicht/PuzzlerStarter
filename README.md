# Thomas' Puzzler Project (PuzzlerStarter)
As part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree course, the Puzzler is a mobile VR project that focuses on VR design for comfortable, intuitive viewing experience. In the game, player enters a dungeon structure made of stone bricks. With floating mysterious glowing spheres as puzzle elements, the player is challenged to solve the mystery through memory.

## Unique Considerations
This project explores the design patterns that gives user intuitive, immersive experience, while avoiding / minimizing simulator discomfort.

# Project Title: Puzzler
The basic structure of the puzzle is based on Simon Says structure, in the VR setting of an ancient looking dungeon space in the desert, under the vast starry sky in the night. Without much instruction, users are intrigued by the nightly mesmerizing scenery, and figure out how to solve the puzzle with few try and error, which keeps the game slightly challenging but captivating.

# Design Process
## Statement of Purpose
Puzzler is a mobile VR experience for users who are new to VR, to explore the immersive experience and new form of user interaction design in VR.

He prefers to explore experience to be easy to understand, straightforward, and fun. He is novice to VR experience.

## Sketches
Here are some UI sketches and scene layout for conceptualizing the project:

UI design Iteration: Simplify UI, and make the restart panel transparent for user to enjoy the view after successfully solving the puzzle
